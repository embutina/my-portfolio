      <h2>A Little About Myself</h2>
      <!-- This section introduces myself and my journey in software engineering -->
      <p>
        I'm Maedot Wondesen, a 2nd year Software Engineering student at Jimma
        University. Currently, I am learning front-end web development. As I go
        further into my coding journey, I want you to join me on my daily
        challenges regarding coding as I make little progress day by day,
        learning and experiencing new things in my daily reflections and
        thoughts. So hop on!
      </p>

      <h2>Any Experience?</h2>
      <p>
        Well, I am just starting this journey now, so don't expect me to have
        past experiences. But don't worry, we can learn and grow together, dive
        into coding adventures, and gain new experiences or skills that will
        help us in the near future.
